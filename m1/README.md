# CMSC 430 Midterm 1

## Instructions

There are 5 parts to this midterm.  Each part has its own directory
with a README and supplementary files.  Read the README in each part
for instructions on how to complete that part of the midterm.

## Communications

If you have questions about the exam, send a DM to ModMail on Discord.
This will go to the entire course staff. Sadly, you will need to verify
your discord account in order to use ModMail.

Answers to common clarifying questions will be posted to the
#midterm-1 channel on Discord.

If you have trouble reaching the course staff via Discord, email
jmct@umd.edu.

You may not communicate with anyone outside of the course staff about
the midterm.

## Submissions

You should submit your work as a single zip file of this directory on
Gradescope.  Unlike past assignments, Gradescope will not provide
feedback on the correctness of your solutions so you are encouraged to
check your own work.
