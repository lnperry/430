Q: At a high level, how would you go about changing the code so that when we
   reach the end of our allocated heap, we end the program with
   "Error: out of memory!"? This way the programmer actually knows what went
   wrong, instead of just seeing "segfault".

   The point here is _not_ to describe Garbage Collection, quite the opposite,
   we only want a clearer error message. You should describe what parts of the
   compiler need to change and how, but you are not expected to implement these
   changes, only reason through them and explain your reasoning.

Q: With the context from your answer to the first part: what would the
   instructions emitted for `box` look like with all of your changes? Feel free
   to use some pseudo-code, but you should still be specifying things
   concretely. So if you need labels, don't worry about generating appropriate
   labels with gensym, we aren't running your code, we just need to get the idea.
