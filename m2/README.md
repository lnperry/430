# CMSC 430 Midterm 2

## Instructions

There are FOUR parts to this midterm.  Each part has its own directory
with a README and supplementary files.  Read the README in each part
for instructions on how to complete that part of the midterm.

## Communications

If you have questions about the exam, send a DM to ModMail on Discord.
This will go to the entire course staff.

Answers to common clarifying questions will be posted to the
#midterm-2 channel on Discord.

If you have trouble reaching the course staff via Discord, email
jmct@umd.edu.

You may not communicate with anyone outside of the course staff about
the midterm.

## Submissions

You should submit your work as appropriate on Gradescope (each question
will have its own section for submitting files/answers). Unlike past
assignments, Gradescope will not provide feedback on the correctness of
your solutions so you are encouraged to check your own work.
